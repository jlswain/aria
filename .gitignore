# Git Ignore
# ==========
#
# Only source code should be checked into the repository. All metadata, configuration,
# temporary or generated files should be excluded from source control. If a resource
# must be added that breaks these conventions then it should be reviewed by at least
# 2 people. Feel free to add exclusions to this ignore but do not remove them.
