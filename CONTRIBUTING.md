Contributing Guidelines
=======================

## General Guidelines

- All pull requests must pass CI
- All pull requests must be reviewed by one person
- No pushing to master
- Pull requests only as big as they need to be
- Write good descriptions for comments
- Explain your interface, not your implementation
- Math should be explained
- 100 characters line max
- All public interfaces need automated tests

## Styles

- No if's without brackets
- Add spaces around operators: do `x + 1` not `x+1`
- No more than 1 level of ternary operator
- No more than 1 level of scope reach

### File Names

File names must have the `.md` extension and should be named as the minor section number with the
section title. For example, a section that would go into the 3-Technical major section and
1-Background minor section with the title of 'Introduction' would be named
`./3-Technical/1-Background/1-Introduction.md`. Please note that the order of the files in the
report directory dictates the order that they are rendered in. This makes the ordering of the files
critical so ensure that it is correctly named.

### Headers

Major section headers should be h1 (`#`). Minor sections should be h2 (`##`). Minor subsections should
be h3 (`###`). All other header levels should not be numbered. To avoid numbering a header, add a `{-}`
to the end of the header line. This character will remove the header from the automatic header
counting.

### Appendix Headers

Appendix headers must be manually set. Appendix headers must start with a letter instead of a number
and should be followed by a dash and the minor subsection number. Please note, there is one less
level of header numbering in the appendix. Appendix letters are actually subsection identifiers and
the major section is ignored.

Appendix headers should be directly linkable and identified by the appendix section and subsection
number. Adding a direct link can be done by placing `{#A-1}` on the header line. For example, the
header in section ### B-1 Automation Systems would be followed by `{#B-1}`. The final result would
appear as: `### B-1 Automation Systems {#B-1} {-}.`

### Tables Headers

Table headers dictate the width that a table is rendered. Table header lines need to be as wide as
possible to accommodate the content of each column.

For example:

```
| C1     | C2                                          |
| -----  | ---                                         |
| Hello  | The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog |
```

Will render as

```
| C1     | C2    |
| -----  | ---   |
| Hello  | The   |
|        | quick |
|        | brown |
|        | fox   |
...
```

To render it properly, extend the header line to the end

```
| C1     | C2                                          |
| -----  | ------------------------------------------- |
| Hello  | The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog |
```

### Links

All direct links must be wrapped in `<url>`. This includes links that are within references. If a
link is not wrapped in this style then it will not be clickable.

### References

References should be placed inline after the sentence that used external information. All technical
information must be referenced. References must be added to the `5-Reference` section of the report
in IEEE format.

For inline citations, use the markdown syntax `[^my-reference]` to refer to a specific reference
point. To maintain unique reference links, reference ids should be different per file. A reference
link in a file should begin with the number of the major section, followed by minor section then
the section title followed by the link number all dash separated. For example, a reference in the
file `./3-Technical/1-Background/1-Introduction.md` file would appear as `[^3-1-Introduction-1]`
(note that the last number is an incrementing number and refers to the link order within that
file).

In the reference section, references must be added in IEEE format and can be linked by using the
following syntax `[^my-reference]: Reference`. For example, a reference from the file
`./6-Appendix/B-Research/1-AutomationSystems.md` would appear in the reference section as
`[^B-AutomationSystems-1]: InsteonÂ®, "Home," in Insteon, Insteon, 2016. [Online]. Available: <http://www.insteon.com/>. Accessed: Oct. 6, 2016.`

**Please note** that the references for appendices are different then normal sections as they do
not have the major section number. The appendix is the only section that does not require the major
section since it will always begin with a unique letter.
