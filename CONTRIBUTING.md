=======================

## General Guidelines

- All pull requests must pass CI
- All pull requests must be reviewed by one person
- No pushing to master
- Pull requests only as big as they need to be
- Write good descriptions for comments
- Explain your interface, not your implementation
- Math should be explained
- 100 characters line max
- All public interfaces need automated tests


## Styles

- No if's without brackets
- Add spaces around operators: do `x + 1` not `x+1`
- No more than 1 level of ternary operator
- No more than 1 level of scope reach
