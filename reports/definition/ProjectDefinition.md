Smart Learning
==============

The Smart Learning system is a learning home automation system. The system will allow a home
owner to set up a collection of devices in their home to automatically control their environment
and automate common tasks. Task automation in the system will not require any user configuration,
instead tasks will be automated based on the user's interaction with devices in the system.

## Description

The Smart Learning is intended to used for home and building automation. This plug and play
system is easy setup, configure, control and expand. By connecting the learning automation hub
to a home network, you can begin adding devices to control. The automation hub provides a simple
interface for controlling the modes of the learning system. A simple remote interface can be
connected to using a web browser to control the hub or any device connected to the home
automation system.

The automation system can connect many different devices which will allow you to expand the system.
As new devices are connected, their input will be used to make more predictive decisions about user
behaviour. New devices can be added to the system by simply plugging them in and turning them on
while in proximity to the central hub.
