# Software Requirements Specification for Learning Home Automation System

## 1. Introduction


### 1.1 Introduction

The Smart Learning system is a learning home automation system. The system will allow a home
owner to set up a collection of devices in their home to automatically control their environment
and automate common tasks. Task automation in the system will not require any user configuration,
instead tasks will be automated based on the user's interaction with devices in the system.


### 1.2 Product Scope

The Smart Learning is intended to used for home and building automation. This plug and play
system is easy to setup, configure, control and expand. By connecting the learning automation hub
to a home network, you can begin adding devices to control. The automation hub provides a simple
interface for controlling the modes of the learning system. A simple remote interface can be
connected to using a web browser to control the hub or any device connected to the home
automation system.

The automation system can connect many different devices which will allow you to expand the system.
As new devices are connected, their input will be used to make more predictive decisions about user
behaviour. New devices can be added to the system by simply plugging them in and turning them on
while in proximity to the central hub.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

Smart home systems are becoming more readily available in the general market place. This system
builds upon traditional home automation systems by adding true automation in the form of learning.
Unlike traditional smart home systems, the Smart Learning system observes user interaction and
automatically makes decisions based on historical behaviours. By combining the fields of machine
learning and home automation, the smart learning system will provide an end user with a more
customized smart home experience.

### 2.2 Product Functions

To provide simplicity and seamless interaction, the smart learning system must be easy to use
and highly interactive. The smart learning system will provide a central hub that will be the
base of computation and communication for all other components in the system.

The system will have many different smart devices. These devices can either be used for control
or for a task. To allow for expansion of the automation system, it must be able to accept new
devices. The system must then retain its previous model of the user's interactions but add in
the new device as evidence for predicting future behaviours. For example, a system might include
a light sensor, thermostat and curtain puller. If the ambient light outside was to drop and the
user closed the curtains then the system might predict that a change in light corresponds to that
action. If the user then changes the temperature, the system may relate light to temperature as
well. If later a temperature sensor was added to the system and the user changes the temperature
when it is too cold, the system will use this information to predict future actions.
