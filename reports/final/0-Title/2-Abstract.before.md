As affordable smart devices become more widely available, interest has increased in using these 
devices to automate everyday tasks in a home.  For a non-technical homeowner, however, a home 
automation system may be difficult to set up. The process of installing and configuring home 
automation can be complicated due to unintuitive user interfaces and the complexity of creating 
rules for smart device behaviour.  The Aria project aims to provide a home automation system that is
easy to install, provides intuitive control of a range of devices, and learns to automate tasks 
without manual programming. The Aria system consists of a single smart hub that can be installed by 
connecting it to power and a home network. Aria is compatible with a range of Z-Wave devices as well 
as Sonos speakers. Both Sonos and Z-Wave devices can be controlled using a single web application 
with an intuitive user interface. Setting up Aria to automate smart devices does not involve manual 
programming; instead, Aria can learn to automate by observation. A homeowner can teach Aria to 
automate simple tasks by performing the desired actions while Aria is in learning mode.
