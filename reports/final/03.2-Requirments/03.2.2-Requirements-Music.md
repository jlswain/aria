# 2. Music Automation

2.1 Background
---------------

Smart home automation should make your life easy and fun. Imagine a group of people arrive at your
house for a party. Your home automation system has learned how to set up your environment to give
you the best experience possible. The lights dim, the temperature goes down, and the music goes up.
Your home is now ready for your guests!

2.2 System Interaction
----------------------

The home automation system will be able to interact with a music system. The remote interface will
allow the user to turn on and off music and control the system volume. The system may also be able
to control the specific speakers that are active and playing music.

The user may choose to schedule the operation of music within the home to start at a certain date
or time. Alternatively, the user may train the system that when many people enter the home then
music should start playing at a certain volume. This could be accomplished by entering training
mode, having a large number of people enter the room and then turning on music. Motion sensors would
be required to measure the occupancy of the home to enable this learning.

Using a similar method to the music training, the user could train the system to tune the
temperature, lights, and any other devices they wish. This could indicate to the system that
when there are many people in the home, all of the trained systems should be activated.


2.3 System Requirements
-----------------------

To be able to monitor the home, the following sensors may be of interest. These sensors will be
use to monitor the occupancy of the home as well as determine the noise level of the home to
appropriately adjust the music.

| Sensor             | Usage                                                    |
| ------             | -----                                                    |
| Beam Motion Sensor | 2 Beam sensors in series can be used to detect occupancy |
| Audio Sensor       | Audio sensor for tuning music volume to the atmosphere   |

The system will require some devices to be able to produce the desired outputs. The following
table lists example devices to allow this system to perform the tasks outlined in this
scenario.

| Device              | Usage                                               |
| ------              | -----                                               |
| Speakers            | Controllable speakers for home configuration        |
| Controllable Lights | Lights that can be controlled by the central system |
| Thermostat          | Controllable thermostat for changing temperature    |
