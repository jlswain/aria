# Project Background

## Introduction 

Provide a general context for the problem (introduce the problem area). This should be brief, since 
the readers are familiar with the problem area (the supervisor has been involved with the project 
and the 2nd reader has been selected because they are familiar with the problem area).

For example, a project might deal with some aspect of data communication for a particular 
application. The introduction would say a bit about the application and the role of data 
communication in that application.
