# Project Background

## Introduction

The field of home automation systems is a young and expanding market. Home automation, or a
"Smart Home" is a building that utilizes physical devices to automate tasks and collect data. The
devices used in the home are connected through a network medium and act as an Internet of Things
(IoT) [^PB-1]. As technology evolves, embedded devices used in smart homes are becoming more
sophisticated, offering more features and better information capturing. However, these advancements
come with a new set of challenges. Higher costs of ownership and more technical experience is
required to operate these new devices keeping the technology from being adopted by the general
public [^PB-2].
