## Introduction

The field of home automation systems is a young and expanding market. Smart Homes are buildings 
which are equipped with devices and sensors that can communicate with and control one another.
Devices are connected through a network and act as an Internet of Things (IoT) [^PB-1]. As home 
automation becomes more popular with consumers, many companies are creating a wide variety of 
sophisticated devices. These companies commonly sell complete home automation 
systems, which contain everything needed to easily install and control their devices in a home.
However, these home automation systems may require some level of technical knowledge and 
manual configuration in order to perform useful tasks. The complexity of installation and management
, as well as the inflexibility of device configurations, are barriers preventing the technology from 
being adopted by the general public [^PB-2].

Many existing home automation systems are not accessible to non-technical users. Consumers may 
require detailed knowledge of a device's inner-workings and how it communicates in order to connect
their devices. Additionally, specifying the desired behaviours of their smart home may require 
operation of a technical user interface, and creation of complex rules. Some commercial systems 
require an installation specialist to set up the smart home.

Home automation systems are difficult to install, complex to manage, and inflexible in their 
configurations. The solution proposed by this project is to use machine learning in a home  
automation system to reduce the complexity of installing and managing a smart home.
