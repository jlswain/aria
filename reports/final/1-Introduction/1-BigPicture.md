## Problem Background

The field of home automation systems is a young and expanding market. Smart homes are buildings 
which are equipped with devices and sensors that can communicate with and control one another.
Devices are connected through a network and act as an Internet of Things (IoT) [^PB-1]. As home 
automation becomes more popular with consumers, many companies are creating a wide variety of 
sophisticated devices. These companies commonly sell complete home automation 
systems, which contain everything needed to install and control their devices in a home.
However, these home automation systems may require some level of technical knowledge and 
manual configuration in order to perform useful tasks. Some large commercial systems even require a
technician to install the system in a home [^PB-3]. The complexity and inflexibility of installation
and management are barriers preventing the technology from being adopted by the general public [^PB-2].

Existing home automation systems often come pre-programmed with behaviours for specific devices. 
Creators of smart devices attempt to anticipate common behaviours that users want in their 
smart homes, and allow users to select these behaviours from a list of options. While this approach 
makes management of smart devices easy, it does not allow for customizable behaviour.

In order to make their systems more flexible, home automation systems often include
the ability to create rules-based configurations. While this increases the flexibility of such 
systems, configuring a rules-based automation system can be complex and difficult to manage. Such 
systems are also often accompanied by a complex user interface. 

The problem of creating a home automation system that is both customizable and easy to manage 
prevents adoption of home automation by consumers. The solution proposed by this project is to 
create a home automation system that allows installation of smart devices using a simple user 
interface, and uses machine learning to simplify configuration of the home.
