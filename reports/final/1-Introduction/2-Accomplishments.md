## Accomplishments

This section lists the capabilities of the home automation system that was built as a solution.

##### Physical Components {-}
The home automation system consists of a Raspberry Pi and a Z-Wave controller USB device. The system
can be connected to a home network using a wired Ethernet connection. The system software is 
started automatically when the Raspberry Pi is powered on.

##### Discovery of Devices {-}

The system supports adding new Z-Wave and Sonos devices through a single button click on the 
user interface. After the user follows the device-specific instructions for setting up their device
and including it in the network, the user can add the device to the system using a button
on the user interface.

##### Device Displayed in User Interface {-}

All devices that have been discovered in the system are visible from the user interface. A web application
allows the user to observe current devcies states. Some basic metadata including name, manufacturer 
and protocol is also displayed to the user.

##### Device Controlled through User Interface {-}

All devices that are visible in the user interface which have a controllable attribute, such as the
brightness level on a light bulb, can be controlled using a web application. The input method used 
to control these attributes is base on the data type of the attribute being changed. For example, 
a binary value such as the On/Off attribute of a light bulb is controlled with a toggle button;
the volume of a speaker is controlled with a slider, and the colour of a light bulb is controlled 
with a colour picker dialog.

##### Events Displayed in User Interface {-}

The user interface receives push notifications whenever events are generated by
devices that are connected to the system. These events are displayed in a live feed.

##### Behaviour Training {-}

The user is able to configure the system to automate control of their devices without writing 
explicity rules. The user trains the system to perform actions by placing the system in 
a learning mode. By manually running through a scenario while in learning mode, the user can teach
the system to recreate the scenario. The capabilities and limitations of the training functionality
are discussed further in [Learning Algorithm](#sec-3-2-12-2).
