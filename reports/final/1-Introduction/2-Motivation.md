## Problem Motivation

Analyze, or expand on, the introduction to show that one or more problems exist in the problem area.
This may include some discussion of related work in the area; however, donâ€™t get too detailed here!
(Instead of details, give short statements of the relevant points and give citations to references
that contain the details.) If more detail needs to be provided to understand your solution or
accomplishments, include a relevant technical section ( in part C ) or an appendix (in part F)
and give a forward reference to the section or appendix.
