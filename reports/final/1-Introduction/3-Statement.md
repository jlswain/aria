## Problem Statement

Give a short, clear statement of the problem(s) being solved. The problem(s) must have been
identified in the motivation discussion. Make sure that you have identified the problem(s) that
your accomplishments have solved. A project often solves only a small part of a larger problem.
In case, the motivation will identify the larger problem and the sub-problems, while the problem
statement must clarify which problem is being solved.
