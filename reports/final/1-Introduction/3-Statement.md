## Problem Statement

Smart home automation is not accessible to non-technical users. Setting up IoT devices can
require knowledge of many levels of the device's inner-workings and how it communicates.
Additionally, scheduling behaviours of devices for the smart home requires operation of a
technical user interface to control, schedule and monitor their behaviour.
