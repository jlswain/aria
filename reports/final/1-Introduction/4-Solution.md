## Proposed Solution

Aria (Autonomous Real-Time Interactive Architecture) is a project that is modeled upon existing
home automation systems with the focus of user interaction, device configuration and device
automation through the use of machine learning. By removing the technical requirements from the
user, we expand the market for home automation consumers. Beyond the essentials of monitoring
and controlling a home, the Aria system aims to provide an element of automation based on
contextual learning from the user's interactions with the system.
