## Accomplishments

List your accomplishments towards your solution. Remember, this is crucial information that will be
used to determine your final grade. Do not make the reader sift through the entire report to
determine what you actually completed.

Sometimes, a project does not completely solve the stated problem. This might be due to unexpected
technical problems, or perhaps an initial under-estimation of the amount of work involved. If this
is the case, be sure to point this out.
