## Health and Safety {-}

At the beginning of the project, out team was investigating the feasibility of building our own 
custom smart devices, such as a lamp or motion sensor, by using a microcontroller to enable wireless
capabilities. However, while investigating this, we discovered that constructing many of these
devices would require working with high voltages. As stated in section 6.12 of the Labratory Health
and safety manual, "Only trained, qualified personnel may repair or modify electrical or electronic
equipment" [^HS-1-1]. Our team is composed of four software engineering students, none of which are
adaquatly trained to work with high voltages. This was a dominant factor in our decision to abandon
the idea of using custom smart devices and to instead use device manufactured by third parties.

No work was performed in a lab environment, so there were no other personal safety concerns during
the duration of this project.
