## Engineering Professionalism

#### General Principles {-}

An important aspect of engineering is communication. Throughout the course of this project, 
different levels of communication with different audiences were required. The most prevalent
communication task was internal. Working in a group effectively demands clear and regular
communication about ideas, project direction, and immediate goals to work towards. The process used
to accomplish this is discussed later in detail. Strong communication skills are an important part
of a larger engineering topic, which is the ability to work in a team.

Part of being an engineer is the ability to work in a professional manner regardless of personal
issues which may arise. An engineer is responsible for improving the quality of work their team 
produces. Our project group has worked towards this by developing an atmosphere where everyone
feels comfortable voicing their opinions, giving and receiving critical feedback, and feels like
they are making a useful contribution to the overall goals of the team.

With the idea of keeping a clear project direction in mind, our team holds weekly scrums. This is 
when we collectively decide what goal is for the next week of development, working towards a more
long term goal. Each team member discusses the work they have been doing and what they plan to 
accomplish in the upcoming week. Once this meeting is completed, our team drafts an email together
to inform our project supervisor of our plans for the next week of development.

Part of the challenge of communication in engineering is identifying the audience and tailoring 
the content to match their level of technical understanding. Our team was responsible for producing
an oral presentation to demonstrate to a faculty member the purpose and status of our project at
that time.


#### Future Concerns {-}

An area of engineering professionalism which future groups developing this project may need to
investigate is the idea of intellectual property. Under the Copyright Act in Canada, computer
software is labeled and protected as a literary work and is protected automatically [^PR-2-1]. This 
means that anyone who is not an owner the copyright cannot produce copies of this software. However,
depending on the future development of the machine learning component, further protection may be
required in the form of patents.

A software patent can only be obtained for an implemented feature which is "new, useful, and 
non-obvious" [^PR-2-1]. If the machine learning aspect of this project improves to the point where 
there is a systematic way to learn desired behaviours with a high degree of accuracy and precision,
it may be worth investigating patent protection. Unlike a copyright, a patent must be applied for
and approved.
