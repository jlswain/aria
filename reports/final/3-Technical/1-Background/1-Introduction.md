The field of home automation systems is a young and expanding market. In recent years there has
been a vast expansion into micro-computing and the Internet of Things (IoT). The smart home
automation system is yet another project in this growing field. This report is intended to give
context and background to this project.

This research report begins by reviewing existing systems to better understand the features
that are currently available, how they work, and where they can be improved. Most of these systems
perform some of the same functionality we are looking to implement, so they are not being considered
for direct use. It then explores individual smart devices that exist on the market for IoT
deployment. The purpose of this information is to help determine which devices are available to 
implement scenarios which showcase the system's learning capabilities. Next, the report moves into
some more technical topics that explore options for implementing this system.

The report will examine the communication protocols available for IoT devices. This research will
determine which protocols are appropriate for our system to support. It then examines some different
embedded computing devices available on the market for custom IoT development. The goal of this
section is to determine what computing device to use as the hub of the system, as well as what
computing devices would be appropriate choices to use in our own smart devices. Finally, the report
investigates the feasibility of building several types of smart sensors, controllers, and actuators,
as opposed to buying them off-the-shelf.
