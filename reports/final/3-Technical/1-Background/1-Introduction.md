### Introduction {#section-back-intro}

The field of home automation systems is a young and expanding market. In recent years there has
been a vast expansion into micro-computing and the Internet of Things (IoT). The smart home
automation system is yet another project in this growing field. This section describes the 
technical details of the project including its research, design and implementation

First the requirements for the project are outline with technical details and requirements
for the system. To better understand the features that are currently available, how they work,
and where they can be improved, the report goes into research of existing system. Most of these systems
perform some of the same functionality we are looking to implement, so they are not being considered
for direct use. It then explores individual smart devices that exist on the market for IoT
deployment. The purpose of this information is to help determine which devices are available to
implement scenarios which showcase the system's learning capabilities. Next, the report moves into
some more technical topics that explore options for implementing this system.

The report then outlines the software designs for implementing the system to meet the aforementioned
requirements. The designs discuss the abstract structures around the system without going into the
specifics of the implementation. This is followed by a more in depth look at the protocols and
interfaces that will be used to communicate between the logical components of the system. This
section is then concluded with the current status of the development of the system.
