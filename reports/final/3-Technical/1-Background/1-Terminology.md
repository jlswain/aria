### Technical Terminology

In order to describe the Aria system and the field of smart home automation, technical terminology
will be required. This section outlines a set of technical terms and phrases that will be used
to describe this field of technology.

###### Real-Time System

A real-time system is a computing system that processes input data within a millisecond window
such that the output is ready virtually immediately [^TT-1]. Real-time systems will be used as
smart devices as well as computing devices in the Aria system.

###### Smart Home

A smart home is an environment that contains sensors and actuators that can be controlled
remotely [^TT-2].

###### Machine Learning

Machine learning is an process for a computer to modify its behaviour based on its inputs [^TT-3].

###### Internet of Things (IoT)

The internet of things (IoT) is a term used to describe a network of embedded devices that send
and receive data via the internet [^TT-4].

###### Smart Hub

A smart hub is an embedded device that all smart home devices interact with as a central point
of communication.

###### If This Then That (TFTTT)
