### Problem Background

The expanding IoT market has sparked a rush of companies to introduce smart home automation
platforms to market. The competitors in this young industry are in a battle to bring their
system to market in order to capitalize on this new sector of technology. These new smart
home system systems offer rich features but have a complex setup process or complex
automation options. The usability of these features limit the access of home automation
to a technical audience. To fully understand the user experience limitations, existing
smart home system need to be examined. This section details a number of existing
home automation systems, outlining their major features and pitfalls. For the complete
research on these automation systems, please refer to [Appendix A](#A).

The smart home automation systems examined in this research included [Insteon](#A-1), [Wink](#A-2),
[Samsung SmartThings](#A-3) and [Apple HomeKit](#A-4). While there are several other smart home
systems, this collection provides a general overview of the market of automation systems. With the
exception of Apple's HomeKit, all of the automation systems are based on the same architecture.
Each system has its own smart hub that smart devices are paired with in order to be controlled
through an app or web browser. The HomeKit differs from these systems by simply connecting devices
directly to a user's smart phone so it can be controlled through their app. While the architecture
of these companies are similar, their methods for device pairing, user configuration and operation
differ. These features of smart home automation all try to solve the same technical issue, bringing
a complex, technical world of device communication and configuration to non-technical users. These
companies must bring the technical tasks of device pairing, device configuration and user
configuration to a non-technical audience.
