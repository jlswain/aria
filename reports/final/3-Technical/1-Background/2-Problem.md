### Problem Background {#sec-3-1-2-1}

The expanding IoT market has sparked a rush of companies trying to introduce smart home automation
platforms to market. These new smart home system systems offer rich features but have a complex
setup process or complex automation options. The usability of these features limit the access of
home automation to a technical audience. To fully understand the user experience limitations,
existing smart home systems need to be examined. This section details several existing home
automation systems, outlining their major features and pitfalls. For the complete research on
these automation systems, please refer to [Appendix A](#A).

The smart home automation systems examined in this research included [Insteon](#A-1), [Wink](#A-2),
[Samsung SmartThings](#A-3) and [Apple HomeKit](#A-4). While many other home automation systems 
exist, this group provides a general overview of the market of automation systems. Except for 
Apple's HomeKit, all of the automation systems are based on a similar architecture.
Each system has its own smart hub that smart devices are paired with. After pairing, the devices can
be controlled through an app or web browser. The HomeKit differs from these systems by simply 
connecting devices directly to a user's smart phone so it can be controlled through their app. 
While the architecture of these companies are similar, their methods for device pairing, user 
configuration and operation differ. These features of smart home automation all try to solve the 
same technical issue: bringing a complex, technical world of device communication and configuration 
to non-technical users. These companies must present the technical tasks of device pairing, device 
configuration and user configuration to a non-technical audience.

The process of device pairing involves connecting a device to the smart hub to be used by the 
system. There are several technical issues when establishing this connection. Connecting a 
device may require knowledge of the communication protocol used by the device, and the location of 
the hub in the network. If this task is left to the user, then the system's usability may be reduced 
to a narrow portion of the public by isolating it to a technical audience. Limiting the amount of 
technical knowledge needed to set up new device could reduce the effect of this technical requirement 
and broaden the usability of the system.

After the device has been paired with the smart hub, it needs to be configured to provide
the hub with meaningful information. This configuration process is typically vendor or device
specific. Often, this process requires managing technical properties of the device which again
isolates a non-technical user. This process too could be automated to an extent, relieving
the user from this technical requirement. Using device defaults and providing a simple,
non-technical mechanism for configuring these devices would also reduce the technical
requirements for this task.

The system must also provide automation features for a user to configure their smart home.
This process too can be over complicated by not providing clear, meaningful representations
of the devices in their home for them. The system must provide a simple method for monitoring
and controlling their environment. Having clean, user friendly controls will allow the system
be usable by any non-technical user.


Eliminating the technical tasks required to setup and utilize a smart home would make this
technology available to a non-technical user and could expand the market of smart home automation.
