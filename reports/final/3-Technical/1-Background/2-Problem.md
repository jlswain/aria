### Problem Background {#sec-3-1-2-1}

The expanding IoT market has sparked a rush of companies to introduce smart home automation
platforms to market. These new smart home system systems offer rich features but have a complex
setup process or complex automation options. The usability of these features limit the access of
home automation to a technical audience. To fully understand the user experience limitations,
existing smart home systems need to be examined. This section details a number of existing home
automation systems, outlining their major features and pitfalls. For the complete research on
these automation systems, please refer to [Appendix A](#A).

The smart home automation systems examined in this research included [Insteon](#A-1), [Wink](#A-2),
[Samsung SmartThings](#A-3) and [Apple HomeKit](#A-4). While there are several other smart home
systems, this collection provides a general overview of the market of automation systems. With the
exception of Apple's HomeKit, all of the automation systems are based on the same architecture.
Each system has its own smart hub that smart devices are paired with in order to be controlled
through an app or web browser. The HomeKit differs from these systems by simply connecting devices
directly to a user's smart phone so it can be controlled through their app. While the architecture
of these companies are similar, their methods for device pairing, user configuration and operation
differ. These features of smart home automation all try to solve the same technical issue, bringing
a complex, technical world of device communication and configuration to non-technical users. These
companies must bring the technical tasks of device pairing, device configuration and user
configuration to a non-technical audience.

The process of device pairing involves connecting a device to the smart hub to be used by the 
system. There are a number of technical issues when establishing this connection. The device
will need to know the medium to communicate with, the protocol to use for communication and
the location of the hub in the network. This process requires a significant amount of technical
understanding to be able to perform. If this task is left to the user then the system's
usability is significantly reduced to a narrow portion of the public by isolating it to a
technical audience. Automating this process could significantly reduce this technical
requirement and broaden the usability of the system.

After the device has been paired with the smart hub, it needs to be configured to provide
the hub with meaningful information. This configuration process is typically vendor or device
specific. Often, this process requires managing technical properties of the device which again
isolates a non-technical user. This process too could be automated to an extent, relieving
the user from this technical requirement. Using device defaults and providing a simple,
non-technical mechanism for configuring these devices would also reduce the technical
requirements for this task.

The system must also provide automation features for a user to configure their smart home.
This process too can be over complicated by not providing clear, meaningful representations
of the devices in their home for them. The system must provide a simple method for monitoring
and controlling their environment. Having clean, user friendly controls will allow the system
be usable by any non-technical user.

Finally, a smart home must provide some form of scheduled configuration. This configuration
should set a device to a specific state at a desired time. This is yet another feature
that needs to be simplified in order to cater to a non-technical audience. The automation of
this process is much more advanced then automating any other task in the system as it involves
prediction of user configuration. Having this process automated would be the final component on
the path to offering a smart home to a non-technical user.

Eliminating the technical tasks required to setup and utilize a smart home would make this
technology available to a non-technical user and could expand the market of smart home automation.
