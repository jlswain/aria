### External Interface Requirements {#sec-3-2-7-1}

#### User Interfaces {-}

##### Remote Interface {-}

The remote interface will allow the user to control the system and any device that is connected in
the network. The remote interface will be a web application that is served to the user's computer
from the learning hub.

###### Accessing the Interface {-}

To load the web application, the user will navigate through a web browser to the address of their
learning hub. The hub will then provide the remote interface and prompt the user with a login. The
first time the user opens the hub control page they will be prompted to create an account.

###### Viewing and Controlling Devices {-}

The primary use of this remote interface will be to observe the state of the system as well as
control any connected device. The remote interface must provide access to the recent history of all
interactions that have occurred in the system. The interface must provide a mechanism for searching
the logs and grouping them based on time and device.

The system must also be able to control the devices that are connected to it. The remote interface
must provide the appropriate controls for each device that is connected to the system.

###### Controlling the Hub {-}

The interface must graphically provide methods to customize the learning hub's operation. This will
include properties related to the system such as network connections, login options and any other
hub specific items.

###### Exiting the Remote {-}

Once the user is finished with the remote interface, they can log out or simply close the web
application. For security reasons, if a user is inactive in their session for more than a set amount
of time then they will be logged out automatically.

#### Hardware Interfaces {-}

##### Learning Hub Interface {-}

To maximize simplicity, the learning hub interface will have a clean and minimal interface. It will
provide the user with three control buttons and one reset button. The control buttons will allow the
user power off and on the device as well as toggle the state between learning mode, normal mode
and standby.

There will also be two external ports on the device. One will be used to power the device from a
standard home wall outlet. The other can be a standard Ethernet port and be used to connect to the
network.
