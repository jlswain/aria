### Overview

#### Introduction {-}

The Autonomous Real-Time Interactive Architecture (ARIA) will allow a homeowner to set up a collection
of devices in their home which will automatically control their environment and automate common tasks.
Task automation in the system will not require any user configuration, instead tasks will be automated
based on the user's interaction with devices in the system.

The system will consist of a hub device with a simple interface that a homeowner can connect to their
home network. After connecting the hub, the homeowner can add enabled devices for the system to
control by simply connecting them to the network. As new devices are connected, their input will be
used to make more predictive decisions about user behaviour.

#### Project Scope {-}

The purpose of the system is to make home automation as easy as possible to set up. Many existing
home automation systems require some form of programming from the user, in the form of a schedule or
explicit scenarios which describe how the devices connected to them should behave. This project will
improve upon such systems by inferring the correct state of connected devices from data collected
during the homeowner's routine use of the devices.

Activities which are "In Scope":

- Provide a range of devices that can be installed in a home which showcase the learning
    capabilities of the system.
- Create a hub device that collects data from installed sensors, and uses this data to infer the
    desired values of actuators.
- Provide a simple interface which allows the homeowner to toggle on/off automated control of
    devices.
- Develop a protocol which allows developers to enable new types of devices for use in the system
