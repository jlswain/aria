#### Background {-}

Smart home automation should make your life easy and fun. Imagine a group of people arrive at your
house for a party. Your home automation system has learned how to set up your environment to give
you the best experience possible. The lights dim, the temperature goes down, and the music goes up.
Your home is now ready for your guests!

#### System Interaction {-}

The home automation system will be able to interact with a music system. The remote interface will
allow the user to turn on and off music and control the system volume. The system may also be able
to control the specific speakers that are active and playing music.

The user may choose to schedule the operation of music within the home to start at a certain date
or time. Alternatively, the user may train the system that when many people enter the home then
music should start playing at a certain volume. This could be accomplished by entering training
mode, having a large number of people enter the room and then turning on music. Motion sensors would
be required to measure the occupancy of the home to enable this learning.

Using a similar method to the music training, the user could train the system to tune the
temperature, lights, and any other devices they wish. This could indicate to the system that
when there are many people in the home, all of the trained systems should be activated.


#### System Requirements {-}

To be able to monitor the home, the following sensors may be of interest. These sensors will be
use to monitor the occupancy of the home as well as determine the noise level of the home to
appropriately adjust the music.

| Sensor             | Usage                                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Beam Motion Sensor | 2 Beam sensors in series can be used to estimate occupancy |
| Audio Sensor       | Audio sensor for tuning music volume to the atmosphere     |
| PIR Motion Sensor  | A PIR motion sensor can detect activity in a room          |

The system will require some devices to be able to produce the desired outputs. The following
table lists example devices to allow this system to perform the tasks outlined in this
scenario.

| Device              | Usage                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Speakers            | Controllable speakers for home configuration        |
| Controllable Lights | Lights that can be controlled by the central system |
| Thermostat          | Allows temperature to be adjusted                   |

#### Sample Sequence {-}

###### Setup {-}

The home's main entrance is equipped with two break-beam motion sensors in series. The devices are
configured so that they provide an estimate of the number of people in the house (OccupancyCount).
Each of the main rooms contains an audio sensor (DenAudio, BasementAudio), and a sound system 
(DenSpeakers, BasementSpeakers). Each room also contains a motion sensor 
(DenMotion, BasementMotion). The basement is also set up with a strip of coloured smart lights.

###### Training Sequence {-}

With their central hub in training mode, the homeowner arrives at the house with a car full of 
people. As each person enters the home, the motion sensors at the door notify the central hub that
the number of people in the house is increasing. The party moves into the den and turns on some music. 
DenMotion reports the activity in the den to the central hub. The homeowner lowers the thermostat
temperature so that the increased number of visitors doesn't make the house uncomfortable.
As the level of conversation increases in the den, the homeowner decides to turn down the music to 
avoid noise complaints from the neighbour. Throughout the party, DenAudio reports changes in noise 
level to the central hub. When the homeowner changes the volume of the den speakers, DenSpeaker 
reports the change in its output to the central hub.

After an hour, half of the party moves to the basement to play some Scrabble. BasementMotion reports
the new activity in the basement to the central hub. The Scrabble players decide to turn on some 
music to get everyone in the mood. BasementSpeakers reports the change in its state to the central 
hub. The homeowner decides to show off his light strips to his friends, and sets them to a dim red
colour to enhance the party ambiance. The light strips report their colour and brightness level to 
the central hub (BasementLightStrip).

At the end of the night, everyone goes home. All music in the house turns off, the basement 
lightstrips turn off, and the thermostat is returned to its normal setting.

The log for this scenario is shown below. This log demonstrates the interactions that would
be logged.

##### Expected Behaviour {-}

The next time the homeowner has a Scrabble party, 10 guests arrive at the home. After they step
through the door and motion is detected in the den, the den sound system turns on and adjusts its
volume to an appropriate level. The thermostat lowers the temperature of the room to 20 degrees. 
The system continues to adjust the volume of the sound system to 
match the amount of noise detected in the room.

A group of the partygoers decide to move down to the basement for their game. When motion is 
detected in the basement, the system turns on the lightstrips to a dim red colour and turns the 
basement sound system on.

After everyone leaves for the night,
