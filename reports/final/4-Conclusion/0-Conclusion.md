# Conclusion and Recommendations

An existing issue for existing smart homes is having their system accessible enough for 
non-technical users. Specifically, the initial system setup, connecting new devices, monitoring and 
controlling connected devices, and configuring behaviours need to be simple and user friendly.

Aria enables a user to connect a new Z-Wave device by pressing the 'Discover' button on the home
page of the user interface. The user must then press the pairing button which is present on the
physical Z-Wave device. At this point the device will be added to the system and can be controlled 
in the same way as every other connected device. Sonos speakers are also currently supported, which 
operate over WiFi instead of Z-Wave. The system can be expanded to support other devices as well. 
Events generated by these devices can be viewed in real-time on the homepage of the user interface. 
To view and control the state of any individual device, one must simply navigate to the 'Devices' 
tab and find the desired device. All devices are displayed with intuitive controls depending on 
their capabilities. Finally, users are able to train Aria to learn specific desired behaviours. This 
is done by placing the system in 'Training' mode, creating a new 'Behaviour', and adding 'Training
Sessions' to that behaviour. A training session is simply the user performing the desired sequence
of events. 

The major feature for future development of the Aria system is the machine learning component. The
current scope of the machine learning does not work well when dealing with continuous values such
as temperature. Modifying the algorithm to be able to handle ranges of values instead of specific
individual values would be a valuable improvement. Another issue which is present is potential 
issues in terms of the scalability of the machine learning. As more sensors and devices are added,
it gets harder to eliminate noise in the data, which leads to undesired learned behaviours not 
being able to be unlearned. A second area for future development is to expand support for non
Z-Wave third party devices. This can be accomplished by adding new software adapters for the desired
devices.
