### A-3 SmartThings {- #A-3}

#### Description {-}

SmartThings is Samsung's home automation system. Similar to  Wink, they provide their own app
allowing a user to control devices using scheduling or IFTTT.

#### Technical Overview {-}

##### Communication Protocols {-}

SmartThings supports devices that communicate using the Z-Wave, ZigBee, or WiFi communication
protocols

##### Device Discovery and Setup {-}

Adding a new device is done through the app. A user will click "find device", prompting the hub
to search for any new Z-Wave, ZigBee, or WiFi devices. When the device is found the user adds 
it to a room and names the device.

##### Network {-}

SmartThings uses a central Hub to connect all of the smart devices. The SmartThings app talks with
the SmartThings Cloud which talks to the Hub which then controls the devices.

##### API {-}

SmartThings provides a Groovy API to create SmartApps that allow control of devices.

#### Summary {-}

The Samsung home automation system provides a reasonable level of support for
different communication protocols, giving it a healthy amount of third party support.
This is something that we will be striving for in out project. The dependency on the 
connection to a cloud service is something that we would like to avoid for our project.
