## A Automation Systems {- #A}

##### Background {-}

This section contains research on existing home automation systems in order to better understand
what technologies currently exist. This research is intended to help understand how a new system
could improve on existing technology or if there are particular architecture patterns that are
relevant for this system's design. In particular, this research focuses on features that are common
between home automation systems and their benefits to the end user.

Since usability is the focus of this system, it is important to investigate the features that a
user would expect in a smart home system. It is also important to examine any short comings of
existing systems and if these short comings can be addressed.

In order to compare these smart home systems, a set of criteria is required such that they can
be evaluated. For this research, the following criteria will be examined: user interaction,
device discovery and setup, network configuration, communication protocols, application programming
interfaces, third party integrations, and limitations. If there are common protocols across all
main automation systems then they should be considered for this system. Industry standard
protocols may be discovered by reviewing these existing systems. If there is a special focus on
the ease of use then this system should consider the efforts that other systems have taken. The network
configuration of a system will govern its performance, power consumption and allowable number of
connections. This research will investigate how these systems organize their network topologies
to satisfy these quality attributes. In order to control these devices we require that the
following; a way to view all connected devices, a way to get notifications when a device in the
system changes states, a way to change the state of a device. Finally, if there are accepted
standards of third party integrations then this system should consider them in its design to
maximize overall interoperability.
