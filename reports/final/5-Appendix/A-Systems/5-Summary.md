### A-5 Summary {- #A-5}

A common theme among existing home automation systems is that systems with a large amount of
third party support rely on a central communication hub. Having a hub allows components from
different manufacturers to communicate to each other through the hub. A challenge that supporting
a large number of devices presents is how to discover new devices into a system, which can be delt
with in several different ways such as manual button pressing or app configuration. 

Looking at these systems also presented several communication protocols to investigate, including
Z-wave, Zigbee, Insteon and WiFi. Along side these are devices from many different manufacturers 
which operate using these communication protocols. Deciding on a communication protocol and 
subsequent device manufactures to support is an important part of our design for our home
automation system.
