## B Computing Devices {- #B}

#### Background {-}

A computing device is any electronic device that can be used to process data and send it over
a smart home network. Computing devices include computers, micro-controllers and other
embedded devices. Computing devices that are being examined all offer control of external
hardware interfaces. This report examines computing devices that can be used for prototyping
embedded control of sensors and actuators.

#### Relation to System {-}

Computing devices will be used for many aspects of the smart home system. A computing device will
be used for the central smart hub as well as for various other devices in the system. Different
devices will be more suitable to some tasks than others. This report compares a number of these
computing options with a focus on the areas of need within the system.
