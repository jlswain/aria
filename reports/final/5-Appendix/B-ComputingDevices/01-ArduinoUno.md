### B-1 Arduino Uno {- #B-1}

#### Description {-}

The Arduino Uno is a small starter microcontroller that is intended for hobby projects and
newcomers to embedded programming. The Uno is intended for rapid prototyping of small circuits
and small embedded systems.

#### Technical Overview {-}

The Uno is a microcontroller that uses the Arduino boot loader software for launching the system
and executing code. The Uno is fully compatible with the Arduino SDK that provides simple
access to all pins and controls on the board. The Uno comes with a 8-bit ATmega328P processor
running at 16 MHz. The system comes with 32 kB of on board flash memory as well as 2 kB of SRAM
and 1 kB of EEPROM. The system boot loader occupies 0.5 kB of the flash memory capacity [^B-1-1].

The Uno comes with 14 digital pins, 6 of which can be programmed to use pulse width modulation.
Included in the microcontroller are 6 analog to digital input pins. The board has a operating
voltage of 5 V and will accept between 7-12 V for input pins. The maximum voltage range of the
input pins are 6-20 V [^B-1-1].

The Uno is a medium sized microcontroller that is 68.6 mm long and 53.4 mm wide. It has a total
weight of approximately 25 g. The Uno also includes an integrated USB-Mini port used for serial
communication and as a power source. The board includes a 5 V DC power input for running the
board continually [^B-1-1].

#### Summary {-}

The Arduino Uno offers fast and simple prototyping options for quickly building embedded circuits.
This board is very useful for rapidly testing but would not be practical in a mass production
system. For the smart learning system, this board would be optimal for experimentation and
quick deployment.
