#### B-2 Arduino 101 {- #B-2}

##### Description {-}

The Arduino 101 is a more sophisticated board that uses the Intel Curie processor for computing.
This board leverages the Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) developed by Intel for running the
board.

##### Technical Overview {-}

The Arduino 101 is the most feature rich board that Arduino is offers. It comes with a full
Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) that is powered by the Intel Curie. The processor is a 32-bit,
8 MHz or 16 MHz backed by 196 kB of flash memory. The RTOS is a light weight OS that only
occupies 2 kB of memory to provide managed, concurrent applications.

The 101 comes with a number of additional features above other microcontrollers in the Arduino
family. Beyond the standard USB-Mini serial connection, the 101 offers a 6 axis gyroscope
accelerometer and integrated Bluetooth. The 101 also provides a 5 V DC power input for
deployment use.

The 101 offers many of the same prototyping capabilities as the Uno with 14 digital pins, 4
of which provide pulse with modulation. The 101 also exposes 6 analog to digital pins.

##### Summary {-}

The 101 is a much more feature rich board than the Uno, however the added features are not
applicable to this project. The 101 also has a much higher price point per unit than the Uno
with no real added value. This makes the Uno a more appealing candidate for rapid prototyping
and simple circuit design.
