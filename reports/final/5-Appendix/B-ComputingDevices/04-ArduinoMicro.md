### B-4 Arduino Micro {- #B-4}

#### Description {-}

The Arduino Micro is the smallest microcontroller of the Arduino family. The Micro also
provides the most external ports of any Arduino making it suitable for large circuits.

#### Technical Overview {-}

The Micro provides high performance embedded computing with a 8-bit, 16 MHz ATmega32U4 processor.
The Micro also comes standard with the Arduino bootloader and a standard 32 kB of flash memory.
The Micro has a operating voltage of 5 V and comes with a standard DC power input.

The Micro has 20 exposed digital pins, 7 of which can be pulse width modulation. These extra
pins make the Micro very suitable for large complex circuits that require many inputs or
outputs. The Micro also has 12 analog to digital pins. The Micro does lack in special features.
It only offers serial communication over a standard USB-Micro port. There are other special
features with this device.

Appropriately, the Micro is the smallest and lightest microcontroller in the  Arduino family.
It is only 48 mm long and 18 mm wide. The Micro also only has a weight of roughly 13 g.

#### Summary {-}

This Arduino would be perfectly suited to a mass production environment where size and weight
were valuable resources. If the learning home automation system was to be commercially
produced, this could be a very valuable microcontroller. This microcontroller could be used
for this system, but would take more effort for prototyping and would likely not be a suitable
fit.
