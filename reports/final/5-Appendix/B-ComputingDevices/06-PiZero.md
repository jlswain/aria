### B-6 Raspberry Pi Zero {- #B-6}

#### Description {-}

The Raspberry Pi Zero is a minimal computer board that offers a full computing platform in a
compact form for embedded computing. The Zero is the smallest board in the Raspberry Pi family
and is ideal for medium to heavy computation with minimal footprint. The Raspberry Pi Zero is one
of the only Raspberry Pi boards that competes for a real embedded computing experience.

#### Technical Overview {-}

The Raspberry Pi Zero has the smallest surface area of any of the Pi's, measuring in at only
65mm long by 30mm wide. To make the board as small as possible, many of the standard Raspberry Pi
features were removed. This means that the Zero has no on-board WiFi, Bluetooth or even Ethernet.
Despite these losses, the board is still equip with a 32-bit 1GHz Broadcom BCM283 processor backed
by 512MB of flash storage.

The Zero provides a lot of room for flexibility with 40 available GPIO pins. The combination of
the Zero's computing power and general IO makes it ideal for small spaces that need a lot of
power.

#### Summary {-}

The Zero could be useful for programming devices in the system; however, while the Zero does offer
a smaller physical footprint and more GPIO pins than the Arduino Uno, it does require more power to
maintain operation. This extra power consumption does come with more performance which may be
useful but likely unnecessary for the smart learning system.
