### B-8 Raspberry Pi 2 Model B {- #B-8}

#### Description {-}

The Raspberry Pi 2 Model B is the second generation of Raspberry Pi designs. The Pi 2 uses the same
design as the Pi 1 with all the same features and more performance.

#### Technical Overview {-}

The Pi 2 is very similar to the Pi 1 but provides a slight faster 32-bit 900 MHz Arm processor. The
Pi 2 has significantly more RAM than the Pi 1 with 1GB of DDR2 [^B-8-1]. The Pi 2 comes with a standard
HDMI video output for monitoring it from a screen. It also is equipped with an Ethernet port and 4
USB ports. The Pi 2 also provides the same 40 GPIO pin configuration as the Pi 1 [^B-8-2].

#### Summary {-}

The Pi 2 outperforms the Pi 1 in all areas and is likely a better candidate for the smart hub. It
uses the same amount of power but provides far more computing performance.
