### B-9 Raspberry Pi 3 Model B {- #B-9 }

#### Description {-}

The Raspberry Pi 3 Model B is the most advanced Raspberry Pi available. The Pi 3 is a
computer board that uses a very similar design to the other Pi Models. The Pi 3 offers more
computing performance than all of its predecessors and is a very suitable candidate for the
smart hub.

#### Technical Overview {-}

The Raspberry Pi 3 offers massive embedded performance with a 1.2 GHz 64-bit Quad-core Arm
processor [^B-8-1]. Similar to the Pi 2, the Pi 3 also comes with 1GB of RAM. As with all other Pi models,
the Pi 3 provides a 40 GPIO pin configuration for external devices. [^B-9-3]

The Pi 3 also comes with a number of standard options that set it apart from all other Pi models.
It comes with integrated WiFi, Ethernet and Bluetooth communication interfaces [^B-9-5]. It has 4 standard
USB ports and an HDMI output for visual feedback [^B-9-4].

#### Summary {-}

The Raspberry Pi 3 is the most advanced Raspberry Pi board available. Its extra computing power
would be a good asset for heavy computation making this an ideal candidate for the central smart
hub. The Pi 3 comes with many standard features including WiFi and Bluetooth communication which
will make external interfacing simple with minimal investment.
