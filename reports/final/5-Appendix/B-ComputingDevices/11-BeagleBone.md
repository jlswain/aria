### B-11 BeagleBone {- #B-11}

#### Description {-}

The BeagleBone is another computing board that is on the edge of embedded computing. The BeagleBone
is a small, feature rich, Linux system for concurrent, real-time embedded programming. This board
could be used for the learning hub or even a small device that requires more computation power than
a microcontroller can offer.

#### Technical Overview {-}

The standard BeagleBone is very comparable to the Raspberry Pi 2 in features and performance. It
is driven by a 32-bit 700MHz Arm processor with 256MB of flash memory. This computing board offers
2 USB ports and a standard Ethernet port for external communication [^B-11-1].

The BeagleBone stands out from the Raspberry Pi with its general pin configurations, as it offers
60 GPIO pins [^B-11-2]. This makes the BeagleBone more suitable for embedded computing than the Raspberry
Pi models. The BeagleBone is a Linux compatible board that comes with the Angstrom distribution [^B-11-1].

#### Summary {-}

The BeagleBone has a number of useful features for embedded computing but does not provide as much
computation performance as the Raspberry Pi 3. The BeagleBone may be suitable for other devices
in the system that require more computational power than what a traditional microcontroller can
provide.
