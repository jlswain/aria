### B-12 BeagleBone Black {- #B-12}

#### Description {-}

The BeagleBone Black is a more advanced version of the standard BeagleBone. It provides more
features and is a higher performance system than the standard board. The BeagleBone Black is most
comparable to the Raspberry Pi 3 board in terms of performance and features. The Black model still
offers all of the major BeagleBone embedded features making it a good candidate for both the
learning hub and other computing devices

#### Technical Overview {-}

The BeagleBone Black is driven by a 32-bit 1GHz Arm processor and is backed by 512MB of RAM. It
also comes with more standard communication options than is predecessor including WiFi and
Bluetooth. The Black model comes standard with 2 USB connections for serial communication and an
HDMI interface for video feedback.

The Black Model uses the same pin configuration as the basic BeagleBone with a few extra specialty
pins. It provides 68 GPIO pins with an additional UART connection.

#### Summary {-}

The BeagleBone Black is does have many powerful features but cannot complete with the Raspberry Pi
3 for the learning hub roll. The Black model may be useful for embedded devices that require
additional computation but since it requires more power than the standard BeagleBone with minimal
gain it may not be feasible.
