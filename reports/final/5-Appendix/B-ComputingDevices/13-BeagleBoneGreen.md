### B-13 BeagleBone Green {- #B-13}

#### Description {-}

The BeagleBone Green is the best embedded option of the BeagleBone family. It is a computing board
that runs a full operating system but has the most available circuit controlling pins. It is an
ideal candidate for both the learning hub and smart devices.

#### Technical Overview {-}

The BeagleBone Green model is powered by the same 32-bit 1GHz processor as the Black model. It also
has the same 512MB of RAM available. Almost all of the core features of the Green model are the
same as the Black model. The Green model stands out with its 4 additional pulse with modulation
pins and 3 additional analog pins. In addition to a UART connection, the Green model provides an
I2C connection [^B-13-1].

#### Summary {-}

The Green model shares many of the same features as the Black and is therefore not an adequate
alternative for the Raspberry Pi 3 and the learning hub. However, the Green does require less
energy than the Black model and is possibly a better candidate for embedded devices.
