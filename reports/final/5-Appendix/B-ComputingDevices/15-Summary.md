### B-15 Summary of Devices {- #B-15}

#### Embedded Devices {-}

There will be a number of applications for embedded devices in the smart home system. There may be
various computing devices that are suitable for different tasks depending on the requirements.
However, for the general needs of the embedded computing in this system, the Arduino Uno will
likely be the most suitable candidate.

The Uno provides a rapid prototyping environment with support for a wide array of custom devices.
It has sufficient computing power with minimal power consumption for the requirements of the general
devices that have been identified in the system scenarios.

As an added benefit, the Arduino community offers many high quality tutorials, examples and
documentation of system usage. The extensive support offered by the community is a major advantage
over the other systems and will be a major asset for developing on this device.

#### Learning Hub {-}

The learning hub will require a significant amount of computational performance to make decisions
about home environment. For this component, full computer boards were considered as they provide
more performance than the available microcontrollers. After a close examination of a number of
computing devices it was determined that the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B is the most suitable
option for this roll in the system.

Since this device is heavily reliant on performance, the decision was reduced to 2 candidates,
the Raspberry Pi 3 and the BeagleBone Black. They both offer considerable performance but the Pi 3
offers more processing cores with a higher clock speed, larger registers and more RAM. This
makes the decision simple, the Pi 3 is the better candidate.
