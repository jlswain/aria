## C Communication Protocols {- #C}

#### Background {-}

There are many different ways to connect devices across a network. A familiar example is WiFi, but
other protocols are available that specialize in different aspects of wireless communication.
The goal of this section is to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of different communication
protocols, and evaluate them against each other.

##### Selection Criteria {-}

The criteria used for evaluating communication protocols are based on the non-functional
requirements identified for the system. The key requirements pertaining to communication protocols
are ease of integration with devices, battery life of devices, range, interoperability, data
transfer rate, number of concurrent connections. Another important aspect of a communication
protocol that will be evaluated is what frequency it operates on.
