### C-2 Z-Wave {- #C-2}

#### Description {-}

Z-Wave is a very similar option to ZigBee, except it has a public application level specification.
Having this application level specification makes it easy to program with, eliminating the potential
for interoperability issues between devices. This is a major component which ZigBee lacks. It another 
low power and low data transfer rate communication protocol, designed specifically for use in an 
Internet of Things project. The Z-Wave protocol is propriatary to Sigma Designs, but a public specification
was released, making it easily accessible [^C-2-1].


#### Technical Overview {-}

One area where Z-Wave differs from ZigBee is the frequency range of operation. It operates at 908.42
MHz instead of at 2.4 GHz, which avoids the issue of conflicting with WiFi signals [^C-2-2]. In terms of
device limits, it is very similar, being able to handle between 30 and 40 devices before issues
start to occur [^C-2-3]. Z-Wave is similar to ZigBee in terms of device range and power consumption.
Z-Wave has an even lower data transfer rate than ZigBee at 40 kbits/sec [^C-2-4].
