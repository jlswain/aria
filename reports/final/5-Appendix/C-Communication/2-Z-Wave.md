### C-2 Z-Wave {- #C-2}

#### Description {-}

Z-Wave is a very similar option to ZigBee, except it uses a proprietary radio design. This slightly
limits the number of devices available for it, as chips are mostly produced by Sigma Designs. The
advantage to this is that because the chips are made largely by one manufacturer, there is a high
level of interoperability. In addition, the Z-Wave protocol includes high-level commands for
controlling certain classes of devices, which further increases interoperability of Z-Wave systems.

Z-Wave goes beyond a network layer protocol and also includes a application-level set of commands
for controlling Z-Wave compatible devices. Devices that implement the Z-Wave protocol are
standardized and can be controlled using the Z-Wave protocol messages.

#### Technical Overview {-}

One area where Z-Wave differs from ZigBee is the frequency range of operation. It operates at 908.42
MHz instead of at 2.4 GHz, which avoids the issue of conflicting with WiFi signals. In terms of
device limits, it is very similar, being able to handle between 30 and 40 devices before issues
start to occur. Z-Wave is similar to ZigBee in terms of device range and power consumption.
