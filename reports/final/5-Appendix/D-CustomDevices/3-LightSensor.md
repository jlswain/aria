### D-3 Light Sensor {- #D-3}

#### Description {-}

This section investigates devices which can detect the amount of ambient light in an area of the
house.

##### Photoresistors {-}

Light sensors generally make use of a component called a photoresistor. The resistance of a
photoresistor differs depending on the amount of light incident to the component. Phtoresistors are
also called photocells.

##### Reliability Characteristics {-}

- Photoresistors are unsuitable for precise lighting measurements because its resistance
 may vary due to temperature as well as light

- Photoresistors may exhibit latency (delay between a change in light and a change in resistance)

##### Photodiode {-}

Photodiodes are components which can be used similarly to photoresistors to detect light.  A
photodiode allows electrons to pass when there is light shining on it. The current allowed to pass
is proportional to the amount of light incident on the device.

Unlike photoresistors, a photodiode is not sensitive to temperature changes and may allow for more
accurate light detection. The circuit required to interface with a photodiode is of similar
complexity to the circuit required to interface with a photoresistor.

#### Expertise Required {-}

Minimal expertise is required to build the devices described by most guides and tutorials.  The
circuit is not significantly more complex than the light switch.

#### Level of Effort {-}

Due to the simplicity of the photoresistor circuit and the wide availability of the required
components and tutorials, a custom-built light sensor is required requires a low amount of effort.

#### Feature Comparison {-}

Many commercially available light sensors are included in combination devices which include several
different types of sensors. Commercial solutions provide very little data about the range of light
that their products can detect. For a custom built solution, the range of detectable light depends
on combination of the particular photocell chosen. Assuming that both a custom device and most
commercial devices are able to differentiate between daytime and evening levels of light, additional
features available from commercial devices are generally related to other types of sensors
