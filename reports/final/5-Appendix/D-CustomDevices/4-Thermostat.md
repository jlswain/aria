### D-4 Thermostat {- #D-4}

This section considers controlling a typical wall-mounted thermostat using a microcontroller such as
an Arduino.

#### Expertise Required {-}

Safety: Controlling a wall-mounted thermostat means working with mains voltage levels.  Without
knowledge in using high voltages, building this device is a significant safety risk

#### Effort Level {-}

Due to the lack of trusted tutorials online, as well as the wealth of features that users are used
to having in a thermostat, the time investment required to build a fully-featured thermostat is
extreme.

#### Evaluation {-}

Due to the extreme level of effort required and the safety concerns with building a thermostat, a
custom-built thermostat is not feasible for this project.
