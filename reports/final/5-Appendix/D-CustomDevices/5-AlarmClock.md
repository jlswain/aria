### D-5 Alarm Clock {- #D-5}

There are a large variety of features available for alarm clocks, this section will focus on a
simple alarm clock that beeps at a programmed time of day. The clock should have manual (button)
input in order to allow the user to set alarm times so that the machine learning component can be
trained. More sophisticated clocks are expected to be much too complex for the team to build.

After review of many online tutorials for building alarm clocks, a common structure for a clock
circuit has been identified.

The basic alarm clock circuit generally requires the following components:

- LCD display
- Microcontroller
- Piezo Buzzer or Speaker
- Varying numbers of push buttons for manual configuration

#### Level of Effort {-}

Due to the need to interface with an LCD display, and because of the large number of components, a
custom build of an alarm clock is expected to be more complex than the light switch. The level of
effort is estimated to be high because of this.

#### Feature Comparison {-}

Homeowners may be used to alarm clocks with nice interfaces, often in the form of an app on their
phone. The custom alarm clocks investigated have significantly inferior interfaces, making use of a
4-button interface to set the time. The clocks considered here also lack features such as adjustable
alarm sounds, configuring multiple alarms, and setting weekly alarm schedules. Making a custom built
alarm clock as usable as commercially available clocks would require significant time investment.
