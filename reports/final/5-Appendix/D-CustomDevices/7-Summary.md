| ------        | --------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| Motion Sensor | Low             | None            | Yes            |
| Light Sensor  | Low             | None            | Yes            |
| Dimmer Switch | Low             | High Voltage    | Yes            |
| Coffee Maker  | High            | High Voltage    | No             |
| Thermostat    | High            | High Voltage    | No             |
| Alarm Clock   | Low             | None            | No             |

#### Conclusions {-}

It is feasible for the team to build motion sensor, light sensors, and an alarm clock if no
acceptable commercial solution is available. We should avoid building dimmer switches, coffee
makers, and thermostats due to the potential high-voltage work involved and the lack of electronics
knowledge available.
