## E Smart Devices {- #E}

#### Background {-}

In the context of this project, a smart device is a device that is capable of communicating over
a wireless computer network, such as WiFi or Z-Wave. Each device provides a set of inputs and
outputs which can be controlled and examined using some protocol.

#### Relation to System {-}

This section examines several commercial smart device products which are available off-the-shelf.
The goal of this research is to determine what types of devices are commercially available, and 
to compare alternative products which have similar functionality. By purchasing off-the-shelf smart
devices, the development time for the project can be focused on building the machine learning 
features, which differentiate our product from many existing automation systems. An awareness of 
existing smart devices will also allow us to select common technologies to support in the system. 
Support for commercial smart devices makes our system more appealing to the end user because they
are not limited to only using devices we create.

Where possible, research will focus on answering the following questions about a product or
line of products:

- What inputs and outputs does the device have? What type of information can the device provide to 
the machine learning algorithm, and what can be controlled?

- Which communication protocol(s) are supported by the device?

- Are the interfaces used to communicate with the device well-documented? Are there tutorials and SDKs
available?

- What restrictions does the device introduce to the system? For example, do users need to create an
account with another company in order to use the device with our system?
