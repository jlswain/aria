### E-4 Wireless Speakers {- #E-4}

#### Available Devices {-}

Speakers that have the capability to provide actions performed to our communication hub are required
to automate music in a home. There does not appear to be any Z-Wave ready speakers available 
currently, and existing WiFi speakers do not provide an API to interact with them. The result of
this is that appropriate speakers for use in our system do not currently exist.

#### Developing Wireless Speakers {-}

It could be possible to create our own smart speakers for use in the ARIA system, but it would 
require a large amount of effort. Development would involve using an Arduino or similar 
microcomputing device to turn a speaker into a device compatible with our system. This implies that
the speaker must be able to communicate using our own defined protocol. Implementing this is not a 
priority for our project, as the value added is limited, but it can be considered in the future if 
there is necessary need. To include smart speakers in our home automation system we will need to
explore developing our own custom devices.
