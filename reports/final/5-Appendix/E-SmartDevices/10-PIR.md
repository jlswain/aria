### E-10 Passive Infrared Sensor {- #E-10}

#### Description {-}

A passive infrared sensor (PIR) is a device that can be used to detect if there are people in a room or 
not. They are available to buy Z-Wave ready, and can be used as a motion sensor in a home environment.

#### Technical Overview {-}

A PIR creates a binary output based on if it the sensor is being triggered or not. This makes it 
useful as a motion detector, as well as being able to detect if people remain present in a room.
It is also feasible easy to develop our own PIR sensors, which is discussed in the Custom Devices 
section of the Appendix.

#### Evaluation {-}

These devices will be useful in our system whenever it is necessary to detect the presence of a 
person in an area. There is a large selection of PIRs available to buy that are Z-Wave compatible,
and it is also an option to construct our own.
