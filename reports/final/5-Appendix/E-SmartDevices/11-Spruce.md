### E-11 Spruce Irrigation {- #E-11}

#### Description {-}

Spruce irrigation is a home plant watering automation system. The irrigation system can be used
outdoors for watering gardens, lawns or any other plant life. The Spruce system is ideal for
scheduling or automating plant watering cycles. The Spruce system also offers automation of water
based on weather conditions and soil moisture.

#### Technical Overview {-}

The Spruce irrigation system uses a combination of wireless sensors, smart sprinklers and a central
hub for controlling the watering levels of its plants. The irrigation system's central hub is
connected to each of the smart sprinklers to control the water flow. Smart sensors are then placed
in various locations on the property and communicate wirelessly to the central hub. The sensors are
placed in the ground and are battery powered.

The Spruce hub provides manual control of all the sprinklers in the system. The hub also provides a
user interface for scheduling sprinkler times and amounts. The Spruce system is also equip with
some learning software that uses weather predictions and moisture amount to optimize water use
for watering plants.

#### Evaluation {-}

The Spruce system provides integration to SmartThings but has no other public APIs. This means
that it is not accessible other systems for communication. The only option for controlling the
Spruce system would be to implement the SmartThings protocol or to attach an adapter to an
existing SmartThings Hub. This is likely onside of the scope of this project but could be
pursued if there was interest.
