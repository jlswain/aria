### E-12 OSO PlantLink {- #E-12}

#### Description {-}

PlantLink is a indoor or outdoor plant monitoring and irrigation system. PlantLink uses a
simple monitoring system where sensors are placed it the target plant's soil for monitoring.
These sensors then report back to a mobile app for monitoring. PlantLink also offers an
automated valve for controlling water flow of a hose.

#### Technical Overview {-}

PlantLink sensors are low power, light weight units that can transmit data with a range of
100-300 ft. The sensor is water resistant and battery powered with an estimated one year battery
life. The sensors are used to check soil moisture of the plants they are monitoring. The sensors
then communicate to your mobile device using email, text or push notifications.

PlankLink also offers a smart valve system for controlling water flow of a hose. The valve system
is solar powered and can be controlled from the PlankLink mobile app. The valve can also
communicate directly to senors to automate the watering of plants. In this mode, if a sensor
reports that the soil is dry then the valve will open up and water the plants.

#### Evaluation {-}

PlantLink is compatible with other platforms but does not offer open source access to its APIs.
PlantLink can communicate with SmartThings, Iris, greenIQ and GRO automation systems. To be
able to integrate with this system we would need to interface through one of these other systems
as an intermediary. The PlantLink system may be outside of the scope of this system unless
there we plan on integrating with another smart system
