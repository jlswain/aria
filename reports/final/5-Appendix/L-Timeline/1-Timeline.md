### L-1 Proposed Timeline {- #L}

At the beginning of the project, the development of the project was planned in a week to week
plan. This development plan had fairly restrictive timelines and did not leave much room for
error. The table below is the originally proposed timeline.

| Milestone                                             | Date               |

| Improved decision making                              | January 18, 2017   |
| Add record and learn                                  | January 25, 2017   |

It quickly became evident that this timeline was too rigid and was not representative of
the true development of the project. At the beginning of October, the vision of the project
was more formally defined with a much clearer end goal for the project. After the project
had been more formally defined, the original timeline was no longer representative of the goals
set for the project.

In order to properly plan the development with these new goals in mind, the timeline had to be
revised. The new timeline for the project does not rely on dates for individual tasks but instead
has set milestones with dates and the tasks that need to be completed for that milestone. Below
is the revised timeline for the project. The first milestone includes the requirements elicitation
which was formalization of the project goals.

| Milestone                                  | Date              |
| -------------------------------            | ----------------: |
| **Requirements Elicitation**               | October 12, 2016  |
| Discovery of devices                       |                   |
| Basic control of devices                   |                   |
| Device displayed in user interface         |                   |
| Event recording in database                |                   |
| Events displayed in user interface         |                   |
| Device control from the user interface     |                   |
| Basic decision system                      |                   |

| Light scenario complete                    |                   |
| Temperature scenario complete              |                   |
| Coffee scenario complete                   |                   |
| **Poster Fair**                            | March 17, 2017    |

This new timeline defines three major milestones that represent concrete deliverable times for the
project. The intermediate goals are all required to be completed before their respective milestone.
To ensure that the project is remaining on schedule, this timeline is reviewed on a weekly basis
and used to schedule and prioritize project tasks.
