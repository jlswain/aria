# Existing Home Automation Systems

This section describes the outcomes of our research into existing home automation systems.
The goal of the research was to determine the feasibility of using  existing 
home automation systems and smart devices the project.

## Nest

Nest offers many smart devices for use with their home automation system. If it were 
possible to use some of these devices with a custom home automation system, we wouldn't 
need to worry about creating hardware components for this project.

Nest provides an API which can be used to control the Nest devices installed in a home.
The API does not allow software to communicate directly with a device. In order to control
a device, the device must be installed into a user's Nest system and set up through the 
Nest app. Our home automation system could then communicate with Nest's cloud services
to control the device.

Use of the Nest API also requires registration in Nest's developer program, which
would subject the project to several restrictions.

While use of Nest's smart devices would allow us to focus on the software aspects of 
the project, it appears that any software that uses Nest devices must be integrated 
with the entire Nest smart home system, which adds a level of complexity that is 
unnecessary for this project.
