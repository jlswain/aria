# Development Process

## Section goals
- How 

## Overall Development Plan

### Develop product vision
- why are we developing the product?
- what can the product do?

#### Activities
- Use case diagrams
- Scenarios

- SHOULD WRITE DOWN Create a roadmap (how to get to the vision)

#### Process
- SHOULD DO Review regularly
- DOING Concrete deliverables for every week

Started with determining the requirements for the project. Gathering of initial requirements
focused on creating a formal definition of what we are building for this project.

Relation to:
- maintainability / modifiability
- testability

## Process
- Iterative approach

Started development by trying to implement a use case that touched every part of the system
- prototyping? 

## Team workflow and source code management

**Problem**
People don't know what the next thing they should work on is so they don't 
do anything. 

**Solutions**
- Visible list of things to do
- Roughly ordered so that people know what to do next

**Tools that do this**

**Github projects**

- kanban-style board for tracking the status of issues
- doesn't provide an ordered backlog easily
- issues backlog isn't all stuff that we're working on right now
- could use columns in a kanban board to represent priority - easy way to prioritize and sort issues

- We don't want another tool, too many tools is just a pain in the ass
- We don't really care about tracking the status of issues in a sprint, we are only 4 people, this is also 
tracked by issues being opened/closed/assigned

- Branching
- Code reviews

## Testing practices

- TDD
- How are we doing integration testing?
- Continuous integration
