## Introduction



## Motivation

## Objectives

Currently, supervised learning algorithms require a complete input dataset and a meticulously
configured output to train the system. We want to have the algorithm be trained in a real world
environment where users perform live actions and the system determines relevant changes and
environmental factors. This automated learning system will be generic and use only the categorical
and numerical information provided by sensors and actuators.

Manual adjustment of a home's environment can be tedious. A goal of the project will be to use the
automated learning system to create a system that can be installed in the home to automatically
adjust the home environment based on input from a number of sensors. The system should support
simple configuration of any type of sensor; the system should not contain detailed knowledge about
any sensors and actuators.

This system will have dynamically updatable configuration of sensors and actuators. This will have
minimal overhead for adding and remove new devices from the system. The smart algorithm will then 
adjust to take these new devices into account when performing its computations.
