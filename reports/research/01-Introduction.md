# 1. Introduction

The field of home automation systems is a young and expanding market. In recent years there has
been a vast expansion into micro-computing and the internet of things. The smart home automation
system is yet another project in this growing field. This report is intended to give context and
background to this project.

The research in this report starts by reviewing existing systems and comparing their benefits and
weaknesses. It then explores individual smart devices that exist on the market for IoT deployment.
Next, the report moves into some more technical topics that explore options for implementing this
system. The goal of the remaining research is to find adequate solutions to the requirements
outlined in the system specification. The research will first examine the communication protocols
available for IoT devices. It then examines some different computing devices available on the
market for custom IoT development. Finally, the report investigates a number of different embedded
sensors, controllers and actuators for actual system development.
