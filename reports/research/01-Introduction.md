# 1. Introduction

The field of home automation systems is a young and expanding market. In recent years there has
been a vast expansion into micro-computing and the Internet of Things (IoT). The smart home automation
system is yet another project in this growing field. This report is intended to give context and
background to this project.

The research in this report starts by reviewing existing systems to better understand the features
that are currently availalbe, how they work, and where they can be improved. Most of these systems 
perform the same functionallity we are looking to implement, so they are not being considered for 
direct use. It then explores individual smart devices that exist on the market for IoT deployment. 
This to help determine which devices are available to implement concrete scenarios which showcase 
the system's learning capabilities. Next, the report moves into some more technical topics that explore
options for implementing this system. 

The research will first examine the communication protocols available for IoT devices. This research will
determine which protocols are appropriate for our system to support. It then examines some different embedded
computing devices available on the market for custom IoT development. The goal of this section is to determine
what computing device to use as the hub of the system, as well as what computing devices would be appropriate
choices to use in our own smart devices. Finally, the report investigates a number of different embedded 
sensors, controllers, and actuators; this will determine the feasibility of building custom smart devices
as opposed to buying them off the shelf.
