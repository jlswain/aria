# 3. Smart Devices

3.1 Background
--------------

What is this section in the context of this system?

3.2 Relation to System
----------------------

We are looking at existing smart devices so that we can see if there are any devices that exist on
the market that our system could use in order to lower the time required to build our own. Adding
support for other smart devices also makes our system more appealing to the end user because they
are not limited to only using devices we create but can go to a store and purchase any device that
use technologies we support.

**Might need to reword**

3.13 Spruce Irrigation
-----------------------

### Description

Spruce irrigation is a home plant watering automation system. The irrigation system can be used
outdoors for watering gardens, lawns or any other plant life. The Spruce system is ideal for
scheduling or automating plant watering cycles. The Spruce system also offers automation of water
based on weather conditions and soil moisture.

### Technical Overview

The Spruce irrigation system uses a combination of wireless sensors, smart sprinklers and a central
hub for controlling the watering levels of its plants. The irrigation system's central hub is
connected to each of the smart sprinklers to control the water flow. Smart sensors are then placed
in various locations on the property and communicate wirelessly to the central hub. The sensors are
placed in the ground and are battery powered.

The Spruce hub provides manual control of all the sprinklers in the system. The hub also provides a
user interface for scheduling sprinkler times and amounts. The Spruce system is also equip with
some learning software that uses weather predictions and moisture amount to optimize water use
for watering plants.

### Evaluation

The Spruce system provides integration to SmartThings but has no other public APIs. This means
that it is not accessible other systems for communication. The only option for controlling the
Spruce system would be to implement the SmartThings protocol or to attach an adapter to an
existing SmartThings Hub. This is likely onside of the scope of this project but could be
pursued if there was interest.

3.14 OSO PlantLink
-------------------

### Description

PlantLink is a indoor or outdoor plant monitoring and irrigation system. PlantLink uses a
simple monitoring system where sensors are placed it the target plant's soil for monitoring.
These sensors then report back to a mobile app for monitoring. PlantLink also offers an
automated valve for controlling water flow of a hose.

### Technical Overview

PlantLink sensors are low power, light weight units that can transmit data with a range of
100-300 ft. The sensor is water resistant and battery powered with an estimated one year battery
life. The sensors are used to check soil moisture of the plants they are monitoring. The sensors
then communicate to your mobile device using email, text or push notifications.

PlankLink also offers a smart valve system for controlling water flow of a hose. The valve system
is solar powered and can be controlled from the PlankLink mobile app. The valve can also
communicate directly to senors to automate the watering of plants. In this mode, if a sensor
reports that the soil is dry then the valve will open up and water the plants.


### Evaluation

PlantLink is compatible with other platforms but does not offer open source access to its APIs.
PlantLink can communicate with SmartThings, Iris, greenIQ and GRO automation systems. To be
able to integrate with this system we would need to interface through one of these other systems
as an intermediary. The PlantLink system may be outside of the scope of this system unless
there we plan on integrating with another smart system
