3.1 Background

What is this section in the context of this system?

3.2 Relation to System
----------------------

We are looking at existing smart devices so that we can see if there are any devices that exist on
the market that our system could use in order to lower the time required to build our own. Adding
support for other smart devices also makes our system more appealing to the end user because they
are not limited to only using devices we create but can go to a store and purchase any device that
use technologies we support.

**Might need to reword**
