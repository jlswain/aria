# 1. Introduction

In order to better understand the motivations for using the
learning home automation system, we have created a number of 
scenarios where we expect the behaviour of homeowners to 
follow patterns that a machine learning algorithm could 
pick up on. These particular scenarios were chosen because
they involve relationships between multiple devices which
may not be obvious. The scenarios also include a list of 
smart devices involved. Using the devices identified in these
scenarios, the team can compile a list of devices which will
showcase the machine learning capabilities of the system for
testing and demos.
