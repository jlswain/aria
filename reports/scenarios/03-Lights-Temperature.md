# 3. Efficient Lights and Temperature

3.1 Background
--------------

Smart home should reduce your energy bills and keep you comfy. During your work week, your home
is left to cool during the day when no one is home. In the evening, before you arrive, the
system heats the house to a comfortable temperature. As you arrive home, the lights automatically
turn on in the rooms that you will enter. Later in the evening, the system cools the house to a
comfortable sleeping temperature and dims the lights.

On the weekend, the house remains warm during the day while you are home. If you leave then
to go to a store, the system turns off all the lights and lowers the temperature. When your
arrive home again the system turns the lights back on and raises the temperature.

In the summer months, when it is more light outside, the system does not turn the home's lights
on until later. In the winter months, the home turns the lights on earlier.

3.3 System Requirements
-----------------------

To enable light and temperature control, sensors will be needed to observe the system. The
sensors will be needed to observe the ambient light and temperature of the home. There
will also need to be sensors to determine the occupancy of the home. The following is a list of
sensors that will be needed for this scenario.

| Sensor             | Usage                                                    |
| ------             | -----                                                    |
| Light Sensor       | Used to determine the amount of light in the home        |
| Temperature Sensor | Need to observe the temperature of the home              |
| Motion Sensor      | Will provide information about the occupancy of the home |
