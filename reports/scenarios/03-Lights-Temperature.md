# 3. Efficient Lights and Temperature

3.1 Description
---------------

During a work week, a home is left to cool during the day when no one is home. In the evening,
before the owner arrives, the system heats the house to a comfortable temperature. As the owner
arrives home, the lights automatically turn on in the rooms that the owner will enter. Later in
the evening, the system cools the house to a comfortable sleeping temperature and dims the
lights.

On the weekend, the house remains warm during the day while the owner is home. The owner then
leaves to go to a store, the system turns off all the lights and lowers the temperature. When
the owner arrives home again the system turns the lights back on and raises the temperature.

In the summer months, when it is more light outside, the system does not turn the home's lights
on until later. In the winter months, the home turns the lights on earlier.
