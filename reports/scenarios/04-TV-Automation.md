### Description

Your family watches Game of Thrones every Sunday evening. Everyone generally moves from 
around the house to meet in the family room, getting ready to enjoy the show. As you settle
in, all the lights on that floor turn off, the television turns on, and the show begins. As
it finishes up an hour later, the floor lights come back on.

The next week is Thanksgiving Sunday, and the family is out of town. The house is silent. 
When Game of Thrones begins, the television remains off, and the DVR silently begins recording
everyone's favourite show. No lights turn on when the show concludes.
