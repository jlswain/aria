# 4. TV Automation

4.1 Background
--------------

Automation of a smart home should go beyond simple tasks and make it easy to stay on top of a busy
schedule. Your favourite TV show is on every week at the same time but your schedule changes from
week to week. The smart home system should recognize that this channel is on at the same time
each week and that it is a show of interest. If one week you cannot make it to watch the show, you
should not be bothered to have to set up the personal recording device, the smart home system
should record the show for you.

4.2 System Interaction
----------------------

The automation system will have to interact with a smart TV in order to communicate the channel
information of the TV. The system will also need to have access to a personal video recording
device.

To train the system to record a show, the user could watch a show one week and then record it the
next week. The user could teach the system that recoding should happen when they are not present
by setting the system to record when they are not in the room. If there are motion sensors then
the system could detect the user's presence.
