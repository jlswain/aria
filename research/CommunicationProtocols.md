Section Title
=============

### Background

  There are many different ways to connect devices accross a network. The every day example is WiFi, but that is not the
only option. There are different protocols available that specialize in different aspects of wireless communication.
To achieve a connected smart home environment, our devices need to communicate to each other and to the system. The goal 
of this section is to discover communication options, and to evaluate them against each other to determine which is most
appropriate for our system.

ZigBee
------------

## Description

ZigBee provides an alternative to WiFi. 

## Technical Overview

  ZigBee uses a mesh networking topology, as opposed to the star topology used by Wifi.  A mesh topology means that every node
in the network is connected. Each node transmitts it's own information, as well as assisting in relaying information received
from other nodes. Having every node connected allows for data to be transmitted between nodes simultaneously, and increases 
network stability be not relying on one central node. This increase in stability come at the cost of having potentially many
redundant connections in the network.

  ZigBee operates within three possible frequency bands: 868-870 MHz, 902-928 MHz, and 2.4-2.4835 GHz. The lowest band only
has one available channel, the middle band has ten available channels, and the highest band has 16 available channels. The
respective data transfer rates are 20Kbps, 40Kbps, and 250Kbps.
