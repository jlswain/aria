Computing Devices
=================

### Background

Computing devices are any electronic device that can be used to process data and send it over
a smart home network. Computing devices include computers, micro-controllers and other
embedded devices.

### Relation to System

Computing devices will be used for many aspects of the smart home system. A computing device will
be used for the central smart hub as well as for various other devices in the system.
