Section Title
=============

### Background

The purpose of this section is to present our investigation into the process of building various types
of devices which might be of use for home automation. The purpose of this investigation is to provide 
information that the team can use to decide which devices will be included in the system to showcase 
its machine learning capabilities. In particular, this section will examine the feasibility of 
custom-building such devices. 

The research will focus determining several characteristics:

#### Expertise required

The team consists solely of software engineering students. Some complex devices will be impractical
for the team to build due to the lack of hardware knowledge available on the team. Factors which 
will be considered in the evaluation of the devices include the availability of tutorials and 
development kits. Safety will also be a critical factor (Does the team have the facilities and 
expertise necessary to build the device safely).

#### Time Investment

The project has a fixed deadline; in order to allow the team to focus on the machine learning aspects
of the system, devices which can be used to demonstrate the system must be available quickly. For each 
device, an estimate of the time investment required to build the devices will be an important factor
in the decision of whether to use a commercially available alternative or not.

#### Reliability

The system is only useful if its decisions are observable through the devices which are connected to it. 
Therefore, we must be abale to trust that any custom devices are highly reliable.

- Compatibility with computing devices and communication protocols

What communication protocols can be supported by the device? How does it interact with a processor?

- Ease of use

The principle objective of the product is to simplify configuration of home automation systems. Devices
which require complex setup are cointrary to the system's objectives.
