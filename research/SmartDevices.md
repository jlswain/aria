Smart Devices
=============

### Background

What is this section in the context of this system?

### Relation to System
We are looking at existing smart devices so that we can see if there
are any devices that exist on the market that our system could 
use in order to lower the time required to build our own. Adding 
support for other smart devices also makes our system more appealing
to the end user because they are not limited to only using devices we
create but can go to a store and purchase any device that use
technologies we support. 

**Might need to reword**
